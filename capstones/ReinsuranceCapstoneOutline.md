Reinsurance capstone

Outline

* Using the data frame provided, 
    * partition policies and associated claims into test, train and validate
    * If any tranche has < 10000 policies, bootstrap a sample that size

* Using the test tranche
    * Experiment with writing a program to decide a fair price for
        * An xol cover for an appropriate retention and limit
        * An aggregate stop loss cover that cedes the same expected value
    * Compare the two covers using Net Benefit of Reinsurance and 2 other metrics
        * Which do you think the cedant would choose?

    * Change your frequency and severity assumptions
        * Which metrics are most impacted?

* Using the train tranche and the strategies from the test step
    * Set your prices
    * When comparing the two covers using your chosen metrics this time, what changed?

* Using the validate tranche and your prices above, who makes more money: the cedant or the reinsurer?

Any aspects of the problem above that are not specified or unclear must be discussed and decided at camp
